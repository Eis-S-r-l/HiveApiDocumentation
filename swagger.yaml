    ### ⚙️ Interfacciamento al Modulo DaaS (Device as a Service) del Portale EIS

    Questa suite di API è fondamentale per **provisionare e configurare i servizi** necessari alla gestione completa del ciclo di vita dei dispositivi (DaaS). Fornisce gli strumenti per gestire l'anagrafica, i cataloghi prodotti, le offerte commerciali e gli ordini di assistenza.

    ---

    ### Flusso Operativo Obbligatorio

    Le chiamate devono seguire la seguente sequenza logica:

    #### 1. Preparazione Iniziale (Dati Base)
    * **Creare Anagrafica**
    * **Creare Categoria / Fornitore**
    * **Aggiungere Prodotto**

    #### 2. Creazione Offerta
    * Creare Offerta
    * Associare Devices
    * Aggiungere Accessori / Servizi

    #### 3. Creazione Ordine di Assistenza
    * Generare un ordine per device

    ### Istruzioni POST e Caricamento File

    Per associare file multipli agli elementi, usare: `"files.{idElement}"`

    Esempio:  
    `files.24 => [ image1.jpg, img2.png ]`

    Nomi file consentiti: A-Z a-z 0-9 spazio _ . -  
    Dimensione max: **5MB**
